    "#### 1. Gradient Boosting Tree Classifier\n",
    "Boosting methods are a widely-used in the machine learning world. The motivation behind it lies in a procedure that combines the outputs of many \"weak\" classifiers to produce a powerful \"committee\" decision. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, the gradient boosting tree (GBT) classifier uses decision trees as \"weak\" learners. Trees can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    T(x;\\Theta) = \\Sigma_{j=1}^{J} \\gamma_j I(x \\in R_j)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "with parameters $R_j$, the region j, $\\gamma_j$ the predicted value for region j and $J$ itself, the number of nodes/leafs on the tree. The boosted tree model is a sum of such trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    f_M (x) = \\Sigma_{m=1}^{M} T(x;\\Theta_m)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In gradient boosting trees, the first tree is fitted on the sample, but then each new tree is then fitted such as to minimize the loss function. The minimization problem can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\hat{\\Theta}_m = \\arg\\min{\\Theta_m}\\Sigma_{i=1}^{N} L \\left(y_i, f_{m-1}(x_i) + T(x_i;\\Theta_m) \\right)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to solve this minimization is the gradient descent algorithm. The tree is then fitted to the negative gradient by least squares:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\tilde{\\Theta}_m = \\arg\\min_{\\Theta} \\Sigma_{i=1}^{N} \\left( -g_im - T(x_i;\\Theta) \\right)^2\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $g_im$ is the gradient of the loss function at iteration m and for all observation $i=1,2,...,N$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    g_{im} = \\left[ \\frac{\\partial L(y_i, f(x_i))}{\\partial f(x_i)} \\right]_{f(x_i)=f_{m-1}(x_i)}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Beside the size of each constituent tree $J$, we have also to choose the number of trees $M$ to be grown. Each new tree reduces the risk of misclassification but it also can lead to overfitting. \n",
    "Another parameter controlling the importance of a new tree is now introduced:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    f_{m}(x) = f_{m-1}(x) + \\nu \\Sigma_{i=1}^{N} \\gamma_{jm} I(x \\in R_{jm})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\nu$ will scale the contribution of each new tree by a factor $0<\\nu<1$: smaller values of $\\nu$ will lead to a larger training risk and control for overfitting. This parameter needs also to be calibrated to the (training) data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Hyperparameters:\n",
    "We are going to implement the GBT algorithm with scikit-learn. There are a certain number of hyperparameter to be chosen in this algorithm. Here below is a list of the relevant hyperparameters in particular for taking into account imbalances:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- **learning_rate**: the learning rate $\\nu$ shrinks the contribution of each tree. There is a trade-off between learning_rate and n_estimators.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- **n_estimators**: the numbers of trees $M$ to be grown or iterations of the algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\- **max_depth**: the maximum depth $J$ of a tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- **subsample**: the fraction of observations to be selected for each tree. Selection is done by random sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- **min_samples_leaf**: this defines the minimum samples (or observations) required in a terminal node or leaf. As our dataset experiences imbalance in its response variable, we will set this parameter to a low value should be chosen for imbalanced class problems because the regions in which the minority class will be in majority will be very small."

    "#### 2. Random Forest\n",
    "Random forest is another ensemble technique of the \"bagging\" kind. The weak learners in random forest are also decision trees. As we discussed, the trees have a high variance and small bias, but unlike boosting, the bagging idea is to reduce the variance of these estimators by averaging them:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\hat{f}^{B}_{rf}(x) = \\frac{1}{B} \\Sigma_{b=1}^{B} T(x;\\Theta_b)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $B$ stands for the number of bootstrapped samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the trees are identically distributed, the variance of the average is given by: $\\rho \\sigma^2 + \\frac{1-\\rho}{B} \\sigma^2$ where $\\rho$ is the pairwise correlation between each tree and $\\sigma^2$ is the individual variance of a tree. We can see that this variance can be reduced if we have a large B and/or a small $\\rho$.\n",
    "The idea behind the random forest algorithm is to grow trees with reduced correlation. This is achieved in the tree-growing process through random selection of the input variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forest is uniquely a variance reduction technique. Indeed, the forest inherits the bias of the tree. Bagging multiple trees will not improve the bias, but the variance will be reduced. Furthermore, random forest has the advantage of having less complex hyperparameters to tune and being easier to implement then gradient boosting trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Hyperparameters:\n",
    "The random forest algorithm is going to be implemented with scikit-learn. The main hyperparameters of random forest in scikit-learn are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- **n_estimators**: the number of trees grown in the random forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- **max_features**: the number of features to consider when looking for the best split. The smaller the value of max_features, the lower the correlation between any pair of trees will be. If this value is too small, we might also face overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also include the following other parameters in the tuning procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- **min_samples_leaf**: the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- **min_samples_split**: the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- **max_depth**: the maximum depth of the tree.\n"

    "#### 3. Comparing our estimators\n",
    "In order to comare the quality of our estimators we are going to use a combination of accuracy indicators: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\- **Precision** is a metric that quantifies the number of correct positive predictions made. Precision, therefore, calculates the accuracy for the minority class. In our case, this is an interesting metric if we want to avoid missclassifying default as non-default customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- **Accuracy** is a metric that quantifies the number of correct positive predictions made out of all predictions that could have been made. In our study, we will want our accuracy score to be at least higher than the proportion of the majority class within the whole dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\- **F-score or f1-score** The F1 score can be interpreted as a weighted average of the precision and recall, where an F1 score reaches its best value at 1 and worst score at 0. The F-score is calculated as follows: F1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)"

    "In this project, I have been investigating the performance of two well-known machine learning algorithms, the Gradient Boosting Tree Classifier and the Random Forest Classifier. These algorithms both use tree as \"weak\" learners but their underlying method is different (bagging Vs boosting).\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient boosting algorithm has been more robust in terms of out-of-sample error on the real data set. However, both algorithms have not achieved an exceptional performance in terms of precision and, even after the hyperparameter tuning procedure. Both algorithms have performed very well on the synthetic dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I think both of these algorithms are suitable for classification problems with imbalance in the response variable. Better performance could have been achieved with a wider grid for hyperparameter tuning, and probably also with data cleaning/feature selection."
